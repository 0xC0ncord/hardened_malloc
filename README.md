Debian stable determines the most ancient set of supported dependencies:

* glibc 2.24
* Linux 4.9
* Clang 3.8 or GCC 6.3

However, using more recent releases is highly recommended. Older versions of
the dependencies may be compatible at the moment but are not tested and will
explicitly not be supported.
